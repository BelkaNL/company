>Terahertz instrumentation was originally designed to deal with cosmic radiation of a very high frequency, from 100 GHz to 3 THz, and was initially developed for space projects, such as the Herschel Space Observatory launched by ESA in 2009, and international ground-based projects, such as the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) to study the birth and death of stars, to research the physics of the cold universe and directly image the formation of planets.  
Besides astronomical research, terahertz instrumentation is perfect for the inspection of the non-homogeneous, electrically non-conductive materials with density variations.  
For example, the terahertz non-destructive testing method was born on the technological arena after the NASA Columbia shuttle catastrophe in 2003. The fatal accident was caused by polyurethane insulation foam that had detached from the external fuel tank, which holds cryogenic liquid hydrogen and oxygen fuel for shuttle main engines. Apparently, the conventional NDT techniques at that time were unable to detect the integrity of the insulation foam.
