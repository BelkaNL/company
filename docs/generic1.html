It has a diameter of 2.8 m and a mass of 5 tons. Designed and made for the first time and has no analogues in the world. This chamber was designed and manufactured by Ducth Terahertz Inspection Services B.V., in cooperation with more than 70 companies, mainly from the Netherlands, but also organizations from other countries. Each of these organizations deserves special mention:.</p>
