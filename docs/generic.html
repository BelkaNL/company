							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/DT4JUICE.jpg" alt="" /></span> <p>The Low Temperature Near Field THz Chamber (LORENTZ), is the newest antenna test facility developed for ESA by Dutch Terahertz Inspection Services B.V. and its multiple suppliers. It is the third lagest facility at ESTEC. It is unique in that it can test antennas in the frequency range upto 1500 GHz in a realistic space environment. The main vacuum anechoic chamber can accommodate instruments with a volume of 1900 mm x 1900 mm with a mass up to 500 kg. The antenna under test can be temperature controlled from 80-390 K (-190c â€“ 117 c) with future plans to go down to 4k (-270 c). Then through a novel design, the antenna pattern can be measured using a 1x1m planner scanner which remains at room temperature. This setup allows for the full end to end measurement of instruments in a truly representative environment.</p>

It has a diameter of 2.8 m and a mass of 5 tons. Designed and made for the first time and has no analogues in the world. This chamber was designed and manufactured by Ducth Terahertz Inspection Services B.V., in cooperation with more than 70 companies, mainly from the Netherlands, but also organizations from other countries. Each of these organizations deserves special mention:.</p>
