 
# What we do

>There is an established trend in aerospace and marine industry that metallic parts are replaced by composite material structures, such as solid laminates of glass fibre and aramid fibre in epoxy resin, or sandwich structures using a core in honeycomb or Rohacell. It implies that instead of identifying corrosion in metallic construction, there is a need to detect new types of defects, such as porosity, delamination, etc., in modern materials, such as composites. To do so, novel non-destructive (NDT) methods are required. TeraHertz (THz) inspection is one of them.

> **Dutch Terahertz Inspection Services B.V. (Anno 2015)** is a fist commercial company in the Netherlands, which offers tailored Terahertz inspection as well as builds the customized Terahertz equipment (at room and cryogenic temperatures) for non-destructive testing and condition monitoring of the internal defects, such as porosity, delamination, etc., particular, in non-conducting composite materials, such as glass fiber, epoxy resin, aramid fibre, honeycomb, Rohacell, and poly-urethane foam, that are often used in aerospace, marine, medical and construction industry. This technology will, for instance, enable FMCW radar, time-domain reflectometry, spectroscopic and phase sensitive three-dimensional imaging at THz frequencies.

# History

> **Dutch Terahertz Inspection Services B.V.** is start-up of the European Space Agency Business Incubation Center in Noordwijk, The Netherlands.

>**Terahertz instrumentation** was originally designed to deal with cosmic radiation of a very high frequency, from 300 GHz to 3 THz, and was initially developed for space projects, such as the Herschel Space Observatory launched by ESA in 2009, and international ground-based projects, such as the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) to study the birth and death of stars, to research the physics of the cold universe and directly image the formation of planets.

>Besides astronomical research, terahertz instrumentation is perfect for the inspection of the non-homogeneous, electrically non-conductive materials with density variations.  
For example, the terahertz non-destructive testing method was born on the technological arena after the NASA Columbia shuttle catastrophe in 2003. The fatal accident was caused by polyurethane insulation foam that had detached from the external fuel tank, which holds cryogenic liquid hydrogen and oxygen fuel for shuttle main engines. Apparently, the conventional NDT techniques at that time were unable to detect the integrity of the insulation foam.
