>There is an established trend in aerospace and marine industry that metallic parts are replaced by composite material structures, such as solid laminates of glass fibre and aramid fibre in epoxy resin, or sandwich structures using a core in honeycomb or Rohacell. It implies that instead of identifying corrosion in metallic construction, there is a need to detect new types of defects, such as porosity, delamination, etc., in modern materials, such as composites. To do so, novel non-destructive (NDT) methods are required. TeraHertz (THz) inspection is one of them.
> 
> **Dutch Terahertz Inspection Services B.V. (Anno 2015)** is a fist commercial company in the Netherlands, which offers tailored Terahertz inspection as well as builds the customized Terahertz equipment for non-destructive testing and condition monitoring of the internal defects, such as porosity, delamination, etc., particular, in non-conducting composite materials, such as glass fiber, epoxy resin, aramid fibre, honeycomb, Rohacell, and poly-urethane foam, that are often used in aerospace, marine, medical and construction industry. This technology will, for instance, enable FMCW radar, time-domain reflectometry, spectroscopic and phase sensitive three-dimensional imaging at THz frequencies.
