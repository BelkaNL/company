> Dutch Terahertz Inspection Services B.V. is start-up of European Space Agency BIC.
> 
> In the end of 2018 the European Space Agency has commissioned a **Terahertz Testing Facility** from **Dutch Terahertz Inspection Services B.V.**. 
> 
> In summmer 2021 its first user was the Sub-millimeter Wave Instrument (SWI), part of the science payload of the **JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE)** spacecraft, which is set for launch in April 2023. SWI has a steerable 30 cm aperture antenna which will scan Jupiter's stratosphere and troposphere, and the exospheres and surfaces of the icy moons Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. It will receive RF signals in two frequency bands, 530–625 and 1080–1275 GHz. In Jupiter's orbit, SWI optics will be at 50–80 K ambient temperature.
